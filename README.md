# 2dUnityChess
 2d unity chess based on Epitome's great unity tutorial on how to make chess like and subscribe to his content it's really great. I pretty much followed the tutorial pretty closly except for making the design of board to follow 2d principles versus 3d because that's how people are used to playing chess on a screen.

This project is currently at the state of the 8th video in his tutorial
things im going to impliment in the tutorial next are the move list and the promotion selection ui

Things i'm going to work on that are not in the tutorial are Draw conditions, castling check when pieces are attacking squares that the king moves through, time control, ai based evaluation board, some basic logic ai and hopfully a machine learning ai. 

Eventually i'm going to do the multiplayer tutorial part, make some chess varients and local bluetooth multiplayer. The project will be forked and closed source for the bluetooth part and maybe some complex variants as I'm thinking of releasing a chess app.
